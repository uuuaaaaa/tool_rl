There are several buildings at the site. But the centerpiece is the One World Trade Center, a skyscraper that is 104 stories and 1,776 feet tall, a height that represents the year of United States independence. This includes the 408 foot spire atop the 1,368 foot tower.\nIt's taller than the original Twin Towers, which were 1,727 feet with the antenna, or 1,362 without.\nThe building has 3.5 million square feet of space, including offices, parking and an observatory, scheduled to open next spring.\nOther tenants include the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the China Center, a liaison for U.S. and Chinese businesses. But many of the floors remain unoccupied. The owners of the tower recently slashed the rent from $75 to $69 per square foot.\nLocated near Wall Street in lower Manhattan, the building was developed by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the 16-acre site.\nOne World Trade Center cost $3.9 billion to build. The planning and construction were complicated by fighting among developers, realtors and insurers.\nThe new building replaces the Twin Towers, which were destroyed on Sept. 11, 2001, when al Qaeda terrorists flew two hijacked passenger jets into the buildings, killing 2,753 people.

Wearing these shoes, Jim won two gold medals that day.\nGiven a news caption and an accompanying image, your task is to classify the type of multimodal misinformation.\n\nThe six possible categories are:\n\n- Image Fabrication: The image is forged.\n\n- Entity Inconsistency：There is a discrepancy between the key entities depicted in the textual and visual modalities.\n\n- Event Inconsistency：There is misrepresentation that arises from excessive inference in the written text for the attached image.\n\n- Time & Space Inconsistency：Using unaltered images or videos that depict past events, but falsely presenting them as recent events.\n\n- Ineffective Visual Information: The image consists of textual information  cannot provide evidence or proof for news content.\n\n- Real News: No form of multimodal misinformation is detected.\n\n\nPlease follow these steps:\n\n1.Reason step by step through an internal monologue, enclosed within <think> </think> tags.\n\n2.After reasoning,you can also call the tool when need in the form:<tool> manipulation_detection </tool> to detect manipulation in the image,or call the tool in the form :<tool> diffusion_detection </tool> to detect diffusion in the image.\n\n3.Based on the above information,provide your answer in the format: <answer> type of multimodal misinformation</answer>,for example: <answer> Real News </answer>.\n\n ",

Other prisoners included Gypsies, Poles, Soviet prisoners of war, as well as homosexuals.\nIt is estimated that as part of the Nazi terror campaign for achieving a racially acceptable Germany, over 100,000 homosexuals were arrested under Paragraph 175, the German law which outlawed homosexuality.  This resulted in an estimated 50,000 convictions, with an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 homosexuals being sent to concentration camps.\nAll who entered a concentration camp suffered and sadly many died. Several accounts indicate homosexuals who were sent to concentration camps were subject to the most horrendous labor roles, harshest punishment, and branded with a pink triangle so they could be easily identified. This includes being used as test subjects for rouge medical experiments, such as vaccine trials, castration, and \"cures\" for homosexuality.  \nIt is estimated that 55-65% of homosexuals sent to the concentration camps died during their imprisonment.\nWhile this day is recognized as a day of remembrance, it should be noted that many homosexuals were forced back into prison after being freed from the concentration camps. This due to the fact that homosexuality was illegal throughout the world. \nUnlike other survivors, it was not until the 1980s that many acknowledged the pain and suffering homosexuals suffered at the hands of the Nazi regime during World War II.\nNever forget!\n#lgbtq #lgbt #history #podcast #letstalkaboutgaystuff #instagay #gayboys #queer #gayhistory #lgbtqhistory #thisdayinhistory  #wwii #auschwitz #birkenau #auschwitzmemorial #concentrationcamp #Jews #pinktriangle #neverforget #stophate  #paragraph175 #rememberanceday #internationalholocaustremembranceday #jan27\nGiven a news caption and an accompanying image, your task is to classify the type of multimodal misinformation.\n\nThe six possible categories are:\n\n- Image Fabrication: The image is forged.\n\n- Entity Inconsistency：There is a discrepancy between the key entities depicted in the textual and visual modalities.\n\n- Event Inconsistency：There is misrepresentation that arises from excessive inference in the written text for the attached image.\n\n- Time & Space Inconsistency：Using unaltered images or videos that depict past events, but falsely presenting them as recent events.\n\n- Ineffective Visual Information: The image consists of textual information  cannot provide evidence or proof for news content.\n\n- Real News: No form of multimodal misinformation is detected.\n\n\nPlease follow these steps:\n\n1.Reason step by step through an internal monologue, enclosed within <think> </think> tags.\n\n2.After reasoning,you can also call the tool when need in the form:<tool> manipulation_detection </tool> to detect manipulation in the image,or call the tool in the form :<tool> diffusion_detection </tool> to detect diffusion in the image.\n\n3.Based on the above information,provide your answer in the format: <answer> type of multimodal misinformation</answer>,for example: <answer> Real News </answer>.\n\n ",

Prisoners that Nazis determined were homosexual were required to wear an inverdet pink trinagle on their chest.\nThe pink triangle was assigned to “sexual deviants.” These included gay, bisexual men, as well as transgender women. \nUnder paragraph 175 of the German Criminal Code, “sexual acts between persons of the male sex” were criminalized. While lesbians were no criminalized under the law, some were still arrested by nazis for “anti-sociality.”\nFrom 1933 to 1944, between 50 000 and 63 000 people were imprisoned on charges of homosexuality. \nGays in concentration camps were seperated from other prisoners, for fear that their sexuality was contageous. They were subject to castration and other bizarre experiments, including forced testosterone injections - which nazis administered to see if it would make them straight. \nAfter nazi concentration camps were shut down at the end of WWII, many queer prisoners were re-incarcerated.\nThe nazi laws against homosexuality remained in place until 1969. West Germany continued to imprison gay men until 1994 under a revised version of the same law. \nIn the 1970s, gay liberation advocates began to reclaim the pink triangle, turning it into a symbol of protest. It became the symbol for ACT UP, an activist group which fought for AIDS research and treatment, the group adopted the pink triangle after conservative pundit William Buckley wrote in a column that “everyone detected with AIDS should be tattooed on their buttocks.”\nEach June, a 70-meter-long pink triangle is installed in the twin peak mountains of San Francisco. The triangle is a celebration of pride and a reminder of the persecution gays faced in Nazi Germany. \nRudolf Brazda was the last known survivor of the holocaust who was imprisoned for homosexuality. After the war, he moved to France and met his lifelong partner, Edi, at a costume ball. They lived together for over 30 years.

The demon attached to the little girl protagonist is called \"Pan\", one of the names of Satan.\nThe Anti-hero is called \"Lord Asriel\", the word \"Lord\" is the Hebrew word Ba'al, another Canaanite demon god and Asriel means \"Prince of God\" (The prince of darkness perhaps?), and his mission, just like that of Lucifer/Satan is to kill the  \"bad guys\" in this abomination, characters called \"The Authority\" and \"Metatron\" who are none other than The Most High himself and Enoch, the righteous scribe, seventh from Adam, and in the final episode Asriel leads an army of fallen angels and men against the forces of the Most High.\nIf you wanted to teach children to hate the Most High, love Lucifer and embrace demonic possession then this series would be the way to do it...

The violence, which continued through November 10 and was later dubbed “Kristallnacht,” or “Night of Broken Glass,” after the countless smashed windows of Jewish-owned establishments, left approximately 100 Jews dead, 7,500 Jewish businesses damaged and hundreds of synagogues, homes, schools and graveyards vandalized. An estimated 30,000 Jewish men were arrested, many of whom were then sent to concentration camps for several months; they were released when they promised to leave Germany. Kristallnacht represented a dramatic escalation of the campaign started by Adolf Hitler in 1933 when he became chancellor to purge Germany of its Jewish population. The Nazis used the murder of a low-level German diplomat in Paris by a 17-year-old Polish Jew as an excuse to carry out the Kristallnacht attacks. On November 7, 1938, Ernst vom Rath was shot outside the German embassy by Herschel Grynszpan, who wanted revenge for his parents’ sudden deportation from Germany to Poland, along with tens of thousands of other Polish Jews. Following vom Rath’s death, Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels ordered German storm troopers to carry out violent riots disguised as “spontaneous demonstrations” against Jewish citizens. Local police and fire departments were told not to interfere. In the face of all the devastation, some Jews, including entire families, died by suicide.\nIn the aftermath of Kristallnacht, the Nazis blamed the Jews and fined them 1 billion marks (or $400 million in 1938 dollars) for vom Rath’s death. As repayment, the government seized Jewish property and kept insurance money owed to Jewish people. In its quest to create a master Aryan race, the Nazi government enacted further discriminatory policies that essentially excluded Jews from all aspects of public life.\nOver 100,000 Jews fled Germany for other countries after Kristallnacht. The international community was outraged by the violent events of November 9 and 10. Some countries broke off diplomatic relations in protest, but the Nazis suffered no serious consequences, leading them to believe they could get away with the mass murder that was the Holocaust, in which an estimated 6 million European Jews died.\nGiven a news caption and an accompanying image, your task is to classify the type of multimodal misinformation.\n\nThe six possible categories are:\n\n- Image Fabrication: The image is forged.\n\n- Entity Inconsistency：There is a discrepancy between the key entities depicted in the textual and visual modalities.\n\n- Event Inconsistency：There is misrepresentation that arises from excessive inference in the written text for the attached image.\n\n- Time & Space Inconsistency：Using unaltered images or videos that depict past events, but falsely presenting them as recent events.\n\n- Ineffective Visual Information: The image consists of textual information  cannot provide evidence or proof for news content.\n\n- Real News: No form of multimodal misinformation is detected.\n\n\nPlease follow these steps:\n\n1.Reason step by step through an internal monologue, enclosed within <think> </think> tags.\n\n2.After reasoning,you can also call the tool when need in the form:<tool> manipulation_detection </tool> to detect manipulation in the image,or call the tool in the form :<tool> diffusion_detection </tool> to detect diffusion in the image.\n\n3.Based on the above information,provide your answer in the format: <answer> type of multimodal misinformation</answer>,for example: <answer> Real News </answer>.\n\n ",

He spread peace throughout the Middle East, while not starting any wars although media propaganda told us he would start world war 3? But just as Biden threw open the southern border that Trump had closed to disease, pedophiles, drug-runners and illegal immigrants, Biden reversed almost everything Trump had achieved. The height was the surrender in Afghanistan of American citizens, allies, friends, the latest weapons, the crucial Bagram airbase. That was a court-martial offence. \nTrump made rules which the Beijing-Moscow-Tehran Axis, Pyongyang, and even Hamas, Hezbollah and the Taliban knew they must obey. What a shame that the Supreme Court refused to hear the strong case brought by Texas and 17 other states that the Constitution had been seriously flouted to deny Donald Trump victory in 2020. This was not only in the 2020 election. Special Counsel John Durham is revealing the facts which began even before Trump’s inauguration and continued with illicit spying on the Trump White House and with the blatant lie about Russian collusion.\nCensorship of reports about the Hunter Biden laptop was so incriminating that the impact was feared even on the rigged 2020 election. \nTrump had Putin under his control and told him that if he invaded the Ukraine, Moscow would be bombed. \nMeanwhile we have the US mid-term elections this November and the Presidential election in 2024. The further decline of the United States must be stopped and for all their faults, how could we manage without them?  The future of the West, including Australia, would be dark indeed.

        "problem": "<image>The news caption is: Military to Miami to Protect President Trump\nBy M. B. - June 9, 2023\nWhite Hats have deployed to Miami in case the Deep State tries to unlawfully detain or disappear President Donald J. Trump on Tuesday, when he is expected to plead not guilty to fabricated federal charges that he kept classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, as well as other baseless allegations.\nOn Thursday, a “secret” grand jury of Biden loyalists indicted President Trump at the bequest of special counsel Jack Smith, who was appointed by Merrick Garland to stop Trump from assuming his rightful place in the Oval Office by any means necessary. The actual list of charges has yet to be revealed, but media outlets have speculated they run the gamut from obstructing a federal investigation to violating the Espionage Act of 1917—groundless claims.\nYesterday’s indictment marks the second time in a few months the Deep State has brought false charges against the lawfully elected President of the United States. The first was in March, when Trump pleaded not guilty to hush money payments surrounding the 2016 election.\nAt the time, General Eric M. Smith recommended that Trump ignore the fraudulent indictment and remain at Mar-a-Lago for his safety. Trump rejected the general’s concerns, saying the Deep State wouldn’t martyr him, that his demise or disappearance would spark Civil War 2.0, prompting a reminder from the general that Trump had survived many assassination attempts. Nonetheless, Trump traveled aboard Trump Force One to New York City. He had entered the courthouse and minutes later emerged unscathed.\nDuring a Thursday evening telephone call with President Trump, General Smith reiterated his concerns, a source in the general’s office told Real Raw News.\n“They spoke for about 20 minutes. Once again, Gen. Smith advised Trump to stay in Palm Beach. It’s his feeling Trump shouldn’t acknowledge the indictment, to force the Deep State to come to him. If they think they can force their way into Mar-a-Lago again, they got another thing coming, like the Judas Priest song says,” our source said.\nBut again, Trump dismissed the advice, saying he wouldn’t hide in a basement like a cowardly Biden.\nGeneral Smith replied he was sending 250 troops to Miami to thwart Deep State treachery. He then upped the number to 500.\n“If you don’t come out of that courtroom Tuesday morning, Mr. President, we’re going in scorched earth style,” the general said boldly.\nTrump guessed the number of feds in Miami would outnumber White Hats five-to-one.\nGeneral Smith said that would be unfortunate—for the feds.\nHe also revealed that his people had identified four members of Jack Smith’s “secret” Grand Jury with personal or financial ties to living and dead members of the criminal Biden regime.\n“They stacked the deck,” Gen. Smith told Trump.\nTrump said he would prevail and that he had a plan.\nIn closing, our source said White Hats headed to Miami are members of the Special Operations community.\nFree Speech and Alternative Media are under attack by the Deep State.

        "problem": "<image>The news caption is: After House Republicans voted to remove Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) from her House leadership post, and she pledged to make sure Donald J. Trump never gets “near the Oval Office again,” the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General’s Corps drafted a sealed indictment charging her with treason and other high crimes against America and its citizenry.\nThe long overdue indictment was signed and sealed after lawmakers gave JAG evidence that tied Cheney to ballot harvesting in her home state, proof that treasonous Cheney is nothing less than a Democrat in disguise. On election night, as Trump was trouncing Biden in Wyoming by 40 percentage points, Cheney was on the phone begging state election officers in 5 precincts to stop tallying Republican votes. Moreover, she verbally assailed Wyoming Secretary of State Edward Buchanan (R) for supporting a “criminal candidate.”\nCheney’s election night antics and hatred of Trump coalesced into sheer lunacy on Jan 6 when she blamed Trump for the Capitol riots, demanding his impeachment, and labelling him “an insurrectionist” guilty of sedition. After failing to rally Republican support, she unprofessionally, unethically, and illegally asked Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance to hasten the state’s tax fraud investigation on Donald Trump.\nWorse, she harangued Trump’s eldest children—Don Jr., Eric, and Ivanka—with a ceaseless barrage of emails and voicemails, demanding they pressure Trump to stay in New York or Florida, anywhere but Washington D.C.\n“It was criminal harassment but had nothing to do with the indictment. The Trumps have the thickest skins of any human beings on the planet, and they blew Liz Cheney off as loony toons, a crazy Karen,” our source said.\nA “Karen” is pejorative slang for a meddlesome, self-entitled, middle-aged Caucasian female who inappropriately insinuates herself into other people’s lives.\n“The indictment is because she betrayed her oath of office and subverted the United States Constitution for personal gain.  It was JAG that chose to indict her,” our source said.\nThe indictment, however, does not signal an immediate arrest. Our source said JAG is curating a cornucopia of indictments, deciding which to act on first. Persons currently basking in media limelight, such as Anthony Fauci, are being shuffled to the back of the pile, while the military targets criminals whose public exposure has diminished, as they are easier to apprehend without drawing unwanted public scrutiny.

Darse E. Crandall and a few high-ranking officers watched in silence while the hangman standing beside Slaoui slipped a braided rope around his neck. Slaoui struggled but was no match for the towering soldier who effortlessly pinned Slaoui’s wrists to his back, then bound them with a zip tie. Slaoui spat in the soldier’s face.\n“Bag the prisoner,” Adm. Crandall ordered, and the soldier put a black hood over Slaoui’s head.\n“How’s that appeal coming along?” Adm. Crandall bellowed.\nAt the end of Slaoui’s tribunal last Thursday, his lawyer, Omar Akbar, promised to appeal the verdict to an unspecified authority. He caught the first flight leaving GITMO Thursday afternoon and hadn’t been heard from since; Slaoui’s calls to Akbar’s office in D.C. went unanswered.\n“It once amazed me, Mr. Slaoui, how little regard you people have for human life. Like others who stood where you are now, you were consumed by greed, which has led to this ineluctable fate. “I didn’t put you on gallows; you put yourself there,” Adm. Crandall said, and motioned at the soldier to push the button.\nBut the hinged door beneath Slaoui’s feet did not swing open.\n“It’s broken, sir,” the soldier said.\n“Allah speaks,” Slaoui muttered from underneath his hood. “He’s not ready to receive me yet.”\nAdm. Crandall said, “He’ll be ready as soon as I can get an electrician here, so don’t get your hopes up.”\nWhile they awaited the arrival of a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers electrician, Slaoui hurled Arabic curses at the admiral, calling him an impious infidel, a blasphemer, and an enemy of Allah. He said Allah and His Messenger would avenge him.\nThe electrician arrived 30 minutes later and tested the box, pushing the green and red buttons after the soldier had moved Slaoui aside. He removed the cover and began fiddling with the wires, commenting that his visit marked the second time in two years a connection had come loose. He fixed it in five minutes, then tested the circuit, pressing the green button to open the door and the red one to close it.\n“All done, Admiral,” he said, and left the platform.\nThe soldier positioned Slaoui, who hadn’t shut his mouth, over the door.\nAdmiral Crandall had fitting final words for the Operation Warp Speed architect. “May you reach your next destination at warp 9.”\n“Allah is gre—” Slaoui began, but his neck snapped before he had a chance to finish his sentence.\nA U.S. Navy physician pronounced Slaoui dead at 10:47 a.m. EST.\n(Visited 8,572 times, 8,572 visits today)\nGiven a news caption and an accompanying image, your task is to classify the type of multimodal misinformation.\n\nThe six possible categories are:\n\n- Image Fabrication: The image is forged.\n\n- Entity Inconsistency：There is a discrepancy between the key entities depicted in the textual and visual modalities.\n\n- Event Inconsistency：There is misrepresentation that arises from excessive inference in the written text for the attached image.\n\n- Time & Space Inconsistency：Using unaltered images or videos that depict past events, but falsely presenting them as recent events.\n\n- Ineffective Visual Information: The image consists of textual information  cannot provide evidence or proof for news content.\n\n- Real News: No form of multimodal misinformation is detected.\n\n\nPlease follow these steps:\n\n1.Reason step by step through an internal monologue, enclosed within <think> </think> tags.\n\n2.After reasoning,you can also call the tool when need in the form:<tool> manipulation_detection </tool> to detect manipulation in the image,or call the tool in the form :<tool> diffusion_detection </tool> to detect diffusion in the image.\n\n3.Based on the above information,provide your answer in the format: <answer> type of multimodal misinformation</answer>,for example: <answer> Real News </answer>.\n\n ",

        "problem": "<image>The news caption is: DeSantis Denied Entry to GITMO Again; Military Threatens to Shoot Him Down\nBy Michael Baxter -March 26, 2023\nFor reasons unknown, Florida Governor and presumptive presidential candidate Ron DeSantis seems desperate to once again access Guantanamo Bay, the infamous detention center where he, as a junior Navy officer, allegedly authorized the force-feeding of Jihadi detainees, a process that involves strapping them to a chair and jamming a lubricated tube down their throats. DeSantis has categorically denied authorizing or witnessing such incidents, saying in an interview with Piers Morgan, “I didn’t have authority to authorize anything. There may have been a commander that would have done feeding if someone was going to die, but that was not something that I would have even had authority to do.” That was in 2006, when DeSantis was a Navy Lieutenant as part of its Judge Advocate General’s corps – serving as a military lawyer.\nIn August 2021, DeSantis had a renewed interest in visiting his old post. He toured the base with Vice Adm. Crandall, stopping at the administration buildings and at Camp Delta before boarding a private jet for his trip back to Florida.\nHis visit caused a stir among White Hats. Both Generals Berger and Smith asked Adm. Crandall and GITMO leadership to forbid DeSantis entry, claiming they had evidence proving the Sunshine State’s governor was a Deep State sympathizer, collaborator, or both, and a card-carrying member of Skull & Bones.\n“If DeSantis is who we think he is, and we’re pretty sure, he has no business at Guantanamo Bay,” a liaison to Adm. Crandall told Real Raw News.\nWhen DeSantis in February tried to schedule a follow up visit, GITMO staff told his spokesperson, Christina Pushaw, that GITMO was closed to uninvited visitors.\nThe rebuff, however, has not stopped Pushaw and other persons in DeSantis’ camp from flooding GITMO’s phones with requests and demands.\n“We’ve been getting four, five, or six calls a day, all saying DeSantis must come to GITMO. He never makes the calls, it’s always one of his representatives, and we’ve told them if we want to see DeSantis, we’ll call him. Until then, he’s persona non grata,” our source said.\nBut still they kept calling, each time sounding more belligerent and forceful, until finally Adm. Crandall personally told Pushaw that “Deep State DeSantis” had forfeit his right to visit GITMO for collaborating with FEMA Director Denise Criswell during Hurricane Ian, when FEMA agents pillaged homes of displaced storm victims.\n“I think that call happened during the second week of March. The persistent calls stopped for a while, and we thought finally DeSantis took a hint. Well, we were wrong, and on March 23rd the calls started again,” our source said.\nPushaw, he said, gave an ultimatum: either grant DeSantis permission to land at Leeward Point Airfield, or he’d come anyway. GITMO leadership discussed the situation with Gen. Smith, who said he would deal with DeSantis’ people.\nA day later, Gen. Smith spoke to Pushaw and issued a stark warning: if DeSantis approached GITMO by air or by sea, he would be declared an enemy combatant and fired upon. She reportedly called Gen. Smith “a monster” and hung up on him.\nWe asked our source a hypothetical question: Is it possible that GITMO has calamitous info on DeSantis that could ruin his presidential aspirations, unflattering info DeSantis might want destroyed.\n“I can’t confirm or deny that. I just know he’s unwelcome here,” our source said.\nFree Speech and Alternative Media are under attack by the Deep State.
