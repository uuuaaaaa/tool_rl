(One particularly emotional video is here). And some New Zealanders even turned in their semi-automatic weapons to authorities. \"This is one of the easiest decisions I have ever made,\" said one gun-owner who had owned a firearm for 31 years.\nJacinda Ardern, the nation’s prime minister, has proved a model of compassion and efficiency, showing up before the Muslim community in a hijab as a sign of respect and earning praise worldwide. \"She symbolically covers her head when she goes to a home for condolences; she boldly underlines her respect and solidarity,\" wrote Turkish lawmaker Cihangir Islam. \"How thirsty we have become for justice and mercy in state administration.\"\n\"We represent diversity, kindness, compassion,\" Ardern said Friday. \"A home for those who share our values.

No wonder. It delivers instant action and joy even with small fish . Today was a bit different. We were catching some serious trout that  hatch naturally in this heavily pressured clear and fast flowing water.\n  Getting an old rainbow trout to bite is not an easy task. Your best bet is seeing a big one, then sit on it and repeatedly present the lure as close as possible until she takes it. To sit on a fish for half an hour in not a long time. No standard trout lures work here, just tiny nymphs and gamarus so Fly fisherman had advantage because of the small  flies trout seem to take with less caution. Well not any more...\nNew SG Trutizimo ultra light rod allowed me to present small 1,5-2 gram jigs with nymph imitations on the shank  as far and as deep as I wanted.  Beside incredible launch thrust of  extremely small baits this rod has enough power to land 2,5 kg fish like this in really strong current. The intensity of landing this marvelous fish with all of  jumping, pulling and other crazy stuff   is something I will never forget. I  have to mention 0,15 mm Okuma SeaMax flourocarbon tippet on 8 LB braid that withheld all of mayhem during the 15 minute fight with this \"native\" old trout.\nI cant remember last time I was that happy and it all goes with Ultra Light approach...\n Check the final moments video of what was a 15 minute fight on http://dalien-fishing.com/ultra-light-trout-clip/'\nGiven a news caption and an accompanying image, your task is to classify the type of multimodal misinformation.\n\nThe six possible categories are:\n\n- Image Fabrication: The image is forged.\n\n- Entity Inconsistency：There is a discrepancy between the key entities depicted in the textual and visual modalities.\n\n- Event Inconsistency：There is misrepresentation that arises from excessive inference in the written text for the attached image.\n\n- Time & Space Inconsistency：Using unaltered images or videos that depict past events, but falsely presenting them as recent events.\n\n- Ineffective Visual Information: The image consists of textual information  cannot provide evidence or proof for news content.\n\n- Real News: No form of multimodal misinformation is detected.\n\n\nPlease follow these steps:\n\n1.Reason step by step through an internal monologue, enclosed within <think> </think> tags.\n\n2.After reasoning,you can call the tool when need in the form:<tool> image_detection </tool> to detect image fabrication in the image.\n\n3.Based on the above information,provide your answer in the format: <answer> type of multimodal misinformation</answer>,for example: <answer> Real News </answer>.\n\n ",

        "problem": "<image>The news caption is: Hollywood legend Tom Selleck has praised Donald J. Trump as President of the United States.\nIn a meeting with Breitbart News, the legendary American actor stated:\n“I’m completely sure that he is the best so far. I’m saying I like this guy.”\n“He’s an answer to our problems. We need to get behind him. The Republicans need to unite behind this man. We need somebody to go in and reconstruct us in a sort of way, get us back to where we were, who we need to be.”\nThen he continued with something truly remarkable:\n“Donald is funny, playful, and colorful, but most of all, he is honest. When he decided to run for president, I know he did it with a true conviction to bring this country back to prosperity. He is the only one who can do it. No frills, no fuss, only candid truths.”\n“I am very disappointed at the talk show hosts, also spewing out lies and propaganda against Donald. Why, I wonder? The only thing I can think of is he represents a form of freedom none of them ever saw before, and they are bewildered about it, and frightened about it. I would say “f*ck you” to all of them. To all that are criticizing him for no reason and want him to resign for no reason. Just go to hell all of you!”\n“I pray all Americans who have seen and felt the meltdown of America with the Obama years, to please fight for Donald Trump. He will not let us down. I pray for all good people to see clearly what faces us now. The right vote will save our nation.”\nSelleck additionally noticed that Trump’s capacity to keep up an inspirational demeanor despite the fact that “he has individuals assaulting him from each side” was likewise a solid contention.This is outstanding people. This guy is a true legend. Thanks for this statement sir.

The secretary could tell in a moment that such backwoods, country hicks had no business at Harvard, and probably didn't even deserve to be in Cambridge.\n\"We'd like to see the president,\" the man said softly.\n\"He'll be busy all day,\" the secretary snapped.\n\"We'll wait,\" the lady replied.\n For hours the secretary ignored them, hoping that the couple would finally become discouraged and go away.   They didn't, and the secretary grew frustrated and finally decided to disturb the president, even though it was a chore she always regretted.\n\"Maybe if you see them for a few minutes, they'll leave,\" she said to him.\n He sighed in exasperation and nodded. Someone of his importance obviously didn't have the time to spend with them, and he detested gingham dresses and homespun suits cluttering up his outer office.\n The president, stern faced and with dignity, strutted toward the couple.\n The lady told him, \"We had a son who attended Harvard for one year. He loved Harvard. He was happy here.  But about a year ago, he was accidentally killed. My husband and I would like to erect a memorial to him, somewhere on campus.\"\n The president wasn't touched. He was shocked. \"Madam,\" he said, gruffly, \"we can't put up a statue for every person who attended Harvard and died. If we did, this place would look like a cemetery.\"\n \"Oh, no,\" the lady explained quickly. \"We don't want to erect a statue. We thought we would like to give a building to Harvard.\"\n The president rolled his eyes. He glanced at the gingham dress and homespun suit, then exclaimed, \"A building! Do you have any earthly idea how much a building costs?\n We have over seven and a half million dollars in the physical buildings here at Harvard.\"\n For a moment the lady was silent.\n The president was pleased.  Maybe he could get rid of them now.\n The lady turned to her husband and said quietly,\n \"Is that all it costs to start a university? Why don't we just start our own? \"  Her husband nodded.\n The president's face wilted in confusion and bewilderment.\n Mr. and Mrs. Leland Stanford got up and walked away, traveling to Palo Alto, California where they established the university that bears their name, Stanford University, a memorial to a son that Harvard no longer cared about.\n You can easily judge the character of others by how they treat those who they think can do nothing for them.\n-- A TRUE STORY By Malcolm Forbes\nGiven a news caption and an accompanying image, your task is to classify the type of multimodal misinformation.\n\nThe six possible categories are:\n\n- Image Fabrication: The image is forged.\n\n- Entity Inconsistency：There is a discrepancy between the key entities depicted in the textual and visual modalities.\n\n- Event Inconsistency：There is misrepresentation that arises from excessive inference in the written text for the attached image.\n\n- Time & Space Inconsistency：Using unaltered images or videos that depict past events, but falsely presenting them as recent events.\n\n- Ineffective Visual Information: The image consists of textual information  cannot provide evidence or proof for news content.\n\n- Real News: No form of multimodal misinformation is detected.\n\n\nPlease follow these steps:\n\n1.Reason step by step through an internal monologue, enclosed within <think> </think> tags.\n\n2.After reasoning,you can call the tool when need in the form:<tool> image_detection </tool> to detect image fabrication in the image.\n\n3.Based on the above information,provide your answer in the format: <answer> type of multimodal misinformation</answer>,for example: <answer> Real News </answer>.\n\n ",

        "problem": "<image>The news caption is: MEL GIBSON'S SHOCK REVELATION ON HOLLYWOOD\nIn a shocking exposé, movie star Mel Gibson has blown the whistle on the epidemic of “parasites” who “control Hollywood” that are involved in child sacrifice and pedophilia.\nThe Lethal Weapon star said that “every studio in Hollywood is bought and paid for with the blood of innocent children,” adding that the “most valuable currency is the blood of babies. While in London, England promoting his latest role in Daddy’s Home 2, Gibson described entertainment industry elites as an “enemy to mankind” who “feast on the blood of innocent children.”\nHe said key players in the movie business “get their kicks from destroying the sanctuary of children” as they “thrive on breaking every God-given taboo known to man.”\n“They have a blatant disregard for the good of the people. Destroying people’s lives is just a game to them – the more pain they can cause, the better the thrill. Children are just sustenance to them. They feast on the pain and fear, and the younger, the better.”\n“These people follow their own religion and use it for moral guidance. It’s not the sort of religious teachings you folks would ever hear about. They perform sacred rituals that are sick and totally at odds with the moral fabric that binds most patriotic Americans. The worst part: It’s an open secret in Hollywood and everyone wants in on it.”\nMel Gibson appeared on British prime-time BBC chatshow, The Graham Norton Show on Friday, where the veteran actor answered questions from shocked guests, in the green room backstage after his appearance, regarding the true nature of Hollywood “elites.”\nHe explained how he had been blacklisted by Hollywood’s controlling oligarchs in 2006 for voicing his opinions about the industry that clashed with their liberal agenda.\nHe said that since then he has been “working outside of the system” which has given him a fresh perspective, saying:\n“It’s difficult to comprehend, I know, and I’m sorry that I am the one to break this to you, but Hollywood is an institutionalized pedophile ring. They use and abuse kids for their own sick ‘spiritual beliefs,’ if you can even call them that. I don’t fully understand it myself, but they harvest these kids for their energy and feast on their blood. They don’t do it mercifully either, they scare the sh*t out of them before they sacrifice them. The more innocent the child, the more terrified they are, the more they thrive on it,” said the Braveheart star.\nWhat does that mean? They aren’t doing this as some form of artistic expression, they are harvesting the blood of children and eating their flesh because they think it gives them some sort of ‘life force.’\n“If the child was mentally and physically suffering when they died, then it gives them ‘extra life force. I don’t understand why they do that, but that’s what they do. Most of us have a moral compass that guides us through life, right? These people don’t have that, or if they do, it’s pointing in the opposite direction.”\nGibson, who has spent the last 30 years working inside and outside of the Hollywood regime, says that the industry’s hierarchy “thrives on abuse, pain, torture, stress, and suffering.\nAccording to Gibson, the desire to inflict such abuse isn’t limited to just the elite, but only “those at the top of the food chain can afford such a ‘luxury,’” although, it’s a “goal for most people in the industry.”\n“Hollywood is drenched in innocent children’s blood. The references to pedophilia and cannibalism have always been there, but for years they cryptic or symbolic. I was introduced to these practices in the early 2000s and was threatened with serious repercussions should I ever speak out. And, I don’t just mean my career, I mean my life was threatened, my family’s life would be in danger. I can only talk about it now as those people, those industry executives, they’re all dead now.”\n“They see the blood of a sexually abused infant as the ‘ultimate prize’ and say that it’s ‘highly enriched. Babies are like a ‘premium currency’ and hold a higher value of anything else you can think of: Diamonds, drugs, caviar, you name it. They are literally trading these kids like a currency for favors, movie roles, kickbacks…”\nAccording to Gibson, this perversion isn’t just the latest fad but has been a deep-threaded culture in Hollywood for generations, and is something popular among both men and women.\n“This isn’t anything new and has been taking place since before Hollywood was even founded. If you research this phenomenon, you will find lurking in the shadows of every dark era in history. These dark, multidimensional occult practices have been used in secret societies for hundreds of years. Hollywood is being used for social programming and mind control and their message is being projected into the psyche of the American people…People everywhere.”\nGiven a news caption and an accompanying image, your task is to classify the type of multimodal misinformation.\n\nThe six possible categories are:\n\n- Image Fabrication: The image is forged.\n\n- Entity Inconsistency：There is a discrepancy between the key entities depicted in the textual and visual modalities.\n\n- Event Inconsistency：There is misrepresentation that arises from excessive inference in the written text for the attached image.\n\n- Time & Space Inconsistency：Using unaltered images or videos that depict past events, but falsely presenting them as recent events.\n\n- Ineffective Visual Information: The image consists of textual information  cannot provide evidence or proof for news content.\n\n- Real News: No form of multimodal misinformation is detected.\n\n\nPlease follow these steps:\n\n1.Reason step by step through an internal monologue, enclosed within <think> </think> tags.\n\n2.After reasoning,you can call the tool when need in the form:<tool> image_detection </tool> to detect image fabrication in the image.\n\n3.Based on the above information,provide your answer in the format: <answer> type of multimodal misinformation</answer>,for example: <answer> Real News </answer>.\n\n ",

I personally agree with every word:\nHe donated £85 million to combat the virus last month – and believes that despite the chaos, there is ‘a spiritual purpose behind everything that happens’.\nFrom Bill Gates:\n‘A SPIRITUAL PURPOSE’\n“I’m a strong believer that there is a spiritual purpose behind everything that happens, whether that is what we perceive as being good or being bad.\n“As I meditate upon this, I want to share with you what I feel the Corona/ Covid-19 virus is really doing to us.\n1) It is reminding us that we are all equal, regardless of our culture, religion, occupation, financial situation or how famous we are. This disease treats us all equally, perhaps we should to.\nIf you don’t believe me, just ask Tom Hanks.\n2) It is reminding us that we are all connected and something that affects one person has an effect on another.\nIt is reminding us that the false borders that we have put up have little value as this virus does not need a passport.\nIt is reminding us, by oppressing us for a short time, of those in this world whose whole life is spent in oppression.\n3) It is reminding us of how precious our health is and how we have moved to neglect it through eating nutrient poor manufactured food and drinking water that is contaminated with chemicals upon chemicals.\nIf we don’t look after our health, we will, of course, get sick.\n4) It is reminding us of the shortness of life and of what is most important for us to do, which is to help each other, especially those who are old or sick.\nOur purpose is not to buy toilet roll.\n5) It is reminding us of how materialistic our society has become and how, when in times of difficulty, we remember that it’s the essentials that we need (food, water, medicine) as opposed to the luxuries that we sometimes unnecessarily give value to.\n6) It is reminding us of how important our family and home life is and how much we have neglected this.\nIt is forcing us back into our houses so we can rebuild them into our home and to strengthen our family unit.\n‘OUR TRUE WORK’\n7) It is reminding us that our true work is not our job, that is what we do, not what we were created to do.\nOur true work is to look after each other, to protect each other and to be of benefit to one another.\n It is reminding us to keep our egos in check.\nIt is reminding us that no matter how great we think we are or how great others think we are, a virus can bring our world to a standstill.\n9) It is reminding us that the power of freewill is in our hands.\nWe can choose to cooperate and help each other, to share, to give, to help and to support each other or we can choose to be selfish, to hoard, to look after only our self.\nIndeed, it is difficulties that bring out our true colours.\n10) It is reminding us that we can be patient, or we can panic.\nWe can either understand that this type of situation has happened many times before in history and will pass, or we can panic and see it as the end of the world and, consequently, cause ourselves more harm than good.\n11) It is reminding us that this can either be an end or a new beginning.\nThis can be a time of reflection and understanding, where we learn from our mistakes, or it can be the start of a cycle which will continue until we finally learn the lesson we are meant to.\n12) It is reminding us that this Earth is sick.\nIt is reminding us that we need to look at the rate of deforestation just as urgently as we look at the speed at which toilet rolls are disappearing off of shelves. We are sick because our home is sick.\n13) It is reminding us that after every difficulty, there is always ease.\nLife is cyclical, and this is just a phase in this great cycle. We do not need to panic; this too shall pass.\n14) Whereas many see the Corona/ Covid-19 virus as a great disaster, I prefer to see it as a *great corrector*\nIt is sent to remind us of the important lessons that we seem to have forgotten and it is up to us if we will learn them or not.\nGiven a news caption and an accompanying image, your task is to classify the type of multimodal misinformation.\n\nThe six possible categories are:\n\n- Image Fabrication: The image is forged.\n\n- Entity Inconsistency：There is a discrepancy between the key entities depicted in the textual and visual modalities.\n\n- Event Inconsistency：There is misrepresentation that arises from excessive inference in the written text for the attached image.\n\n- Time & Space Inconsistency：Using unaltered images or videos that depict past events, but falsely presenting them as recent events.\n\n- Ineffective Visual Information: The image consists of textual information  cannot provide evidence or proof for news content.\n\n- Real News: No form of multimodal misinformation is detected.\n\n\nPlease follow these steps:\n\n1.Reason step by step through an internal monologue, enclosed within <think> </think> tags.\n\n2.After reasoning,you can call the tool when need in the form:<tool> image_detection </tool> to detect image fabrication in the image.\n\n3.Based on the above information,provide your answer in the format: <answer> type of multimodal misinformation</answer>,for example: <answer> Real News </answer>.\n\n ",

        "problem": "<image>The news caption is: Abolishing Columbus day needs to go hand in hand with rescinding, repudiating, and dismantling the Doctrine Of Discovery and it's ongoing legacy:\n\"Origin narratives form the vital core of a people’s unifying identity and of the values that guide them. In the United States, the founding and development of the Anglo-American settler-state involves a narrative about Puritan settlers who had a covenant with God to take the land. That part of the origin story is supported and reinforced by the Columbus myth and the “Doctrine of Discovery.” According to a series of late-fifteenth-century papal bulls, European nations acquired title to the lands they “discovered” and the Indigenous inhabitants lost their natural right to that land after Europeans arrived and claimed it. [5] As law professor Robert A. Williams observes about the Doctrine of Discovery:\nResponding to the requirements of a paradoxical age of Renaissance and Inquisition, the West’s first modern discourses of conquest articulated a vision of all humankind united under a rule of law discoverable solely by human reason. Unfortunately for the American Indian, the West’s first tentative steps towards this noble vision of a Law of Nations contained a mandate for Europe’s subjugation of all peoples whose radical divergence from European-derived norms of right conduct signified their need for conquest and remediation. \nThe Columbus myth suggests that from US independence onward, colonial settlers saw themselves as part of a world system of colonization. “Columbia,” the poetic, Latinate name used in reference to the United States from its founding throughout the nineteenth century, was based on the name of Christopher Columbus. The “Land of Columbus” was—and still is—represented by the image of a woman in sculptures and paintings, by institutions such as Columbia University, and by countless place names, including that of the national capital, the District of Columbia. The 1798 hymn “Hail, Columbia” was the early national anthem and is now used whenever the vice president of the United States makes a public appearance, and Columbus Day is still a federal holiday despite Columbus never having set foot on any territory ever claimed by the United States.\"\nhttps://www.google.com/.../how-we-are-often-trapped.../amp/\nGiven a news caption and an accompanying image, your task is to classify the type of multimodal misinformation.\n\nThe six possible categories are:\n\n- Image Fabrication: The image is forged.\n\n- Entity Inconsistency：There is a discrepancy between the key entities depicted in the textual and visual modalities.\n\n- Event Inconsistency：There is misrepresentation that arises from excessive inference in the written text for the attached image.\n\n- Time & Space Inconsistency：Using unaltered images or videos that depict past events, but falsely presenting them as recent events.\n\n- Ineffective Visual Information: The image consists of textual information  cannot provide evidence or proof for news content.\n\n- Real News: No form of multimodal misinformation is detected.\n\n\nPlease follow these steps:\n\n1.Reason step by step through an internal monologue, enclosed within <think> </think> tags.\n\n2.After reasoning,you can call the tool when need in the form:<tool> image_detection </tool> to detect image fabrication in the image.\n\n3.Based on the above information,provide your answer in the format: <answer> type of multimodal misinformation</answer>,for example: <answer> Real News </answer>.\n\n ",

Trump co-authored a flurry of sealed indictments, one of which charges Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett with high crimes and misdemeanors against America and its people, said a former USDOJ employee who helped Trump and then-acting AG Jeffrey Rosen research casework.\nOur source said Trump spent days pondering whether to formally charge the 49-year-old mother of seven, but concluded that Barret’s betrayal to both him and the U.S Constitution could not go unpunished.\n“Trump is a merciful man willing to accept almost anyone’s apology, but he couldn’t give her a free pass. Not after her ultimate betrayal,” our source said.\nOn September 26, Trump triumphantly announced his nomination of Amy Coney Barrett in a ceremony at the White House Rose Garden before an audience of top Washington officials, other dignitaries, and family members. Barrett was seen as the conservative poster girl who would bring parity to the Supreme Court and stop the liberal left from hijacking the 2020 presidential election. For weeks, Trump championed her, showing her off at every possible opportunity.\nThe Senate confirmed her to the Supreme Court on October 26, and two days later she stabbed Trump in the back. On October 28, the Supreme Court ruled on Republican Party of Pennsylvania v. Kathy Boockvar, Secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, ruling in her favor. Boockvar wanted to extend the deadline for absentee ballots; the Republicans sought an injunction.\nThere is strength in unity and America is a great example of it to the countries across the world. In the need of the hour, each patriot has sacrificed their needs to help out a fellow citizen.\nHowever, hope can be lost in the darkest times, and the American people need something to unify them in such times of adversity.

He added: “We don’t have much left of a democracy at all. Getting out on the streets is one of the few beacons of democracy we have left.”\nCeira Sergeant, a leader in the youth wing of the rejoin movement, said she was too young to vote in the 2016 referendum.\nShe said: “Everytime I come to London I’m stunned by just how positive everyone is. It’s the best turnout I have ever seen.\n“I have true faith we will rejoin in my lifetime. In the last year this movement has grown exponentially.\n“Everybody in power needs to wake up to what young people especially want.”\nHowever, not everyone was in support. One motorist heckled the activists, shouting: “You’re wasting your time”. But others on an open top bus passing the rally gave their thumbs up to the cheering activists,\nIt was the second annual march held - although this year’s event started off slowly, the crowds swelled in the sunshine like last year when thousands of people joined. Those taking part want to put rejoining the EU back on the agenda.\nIt comes as The Independent reveals Keir Starmer held secret talks with Emmanuel Macron about Brexit. The Labour leader has said he will seek to improve the government’s Brexit deal – but also insisted there is no case for rejoining the EU, its single market, or customs union.\nAs the march started, Madeleina Kay, 29, said the country had taken a “darker turn” after the Brexit referendum in 2016.\nMs Kay, who was awarded Young European of the Year by the Schwarzkopf Foundation in 2018, said: “I was very disappointed thought it was a different country. The only people I’m angry at are the politicians because they lied to us.\n“They’ve let everybody down and we can see the consequences of that now, the cost of living crisis they have taken rights away from us.\n“Rejoining is going to be a long campaign but the younger people voted Remain and that is the future.”\nProud Welshman Gareth Kearns, 53, said: “People always say only old people for Brexit is sort of true but when you get to the very elderly the people who actually remember the Second World War they are with us. But they can’t be expected to go on a long march from here, they all take a shorter route.”\nOn the march reaching Parliament Square, dancers waved EU flags while preparations were made for the speeches. German MEP Terry Reintke told those watching: “When I see thousands of Europeans in the streets it makes me so hopeful that we will be back together again.\n“The EU is far from perfect we know this. We live in a cost of living crisis, we see war in Ukraine where geopolitical situation is really hard. Europeans are struggling.

        "problem": "<image>The news caption is: While most Americans sat glued to televisions and electronic devices on the evening of November 8, a blistering firefight between U.S. Marines devoted to restoring order to the Republic and federal agents loyal to the criminal Biden regime took place at the Federal Reserve headquarters in Washington D.C., with the Marines suffering a crushing defeat, Real Raw News can now report.\nAlthough RRN takes no pleasure in highlighting White Hat losses, we have an obligation to report them, just as we do their triumphs.\nOn the morning of November 8, General David H. Berger greenlit an operation to seize control of the Federal Reserve after learning that the criminal Biden regime was in the process of buttressing the building’s security with a 10’ tall perimeter wall to prevent the outside world from discovering that the criminals within were minting billions and billions of dollars—fiat currency unbacked by gold—meant to reach the hands of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\nSources in Gen. Berger’s office told RRN that the general spoke to both President Trump and Trump’s advisors before committing to the raid. The consensus, he added, was that the Fed would be dark and mostly empty due to it being Election Day, with only a small contingent of treasury agents guarding the 6-story, steel beam structure.\nGeneral Berger, sources added, handpicked two Marine Scout-Sniper platoons comprised of 24 men to fulfill the mission, the objectives of which included surveilling the building, eliminating or subduing opposition, and destroying the engraving & printing machines. The Marines arrived at the Fed at about 1:00 am an exploited a gap in the wall that was still under construction. While snipers provided overwatch, the other Marines stealthily approached the front doors—then all hell broke loose.\nThe doors flung open, and treasury agents equipped with NVGs and armed with automatic rifles unleashed a phalanx of bullets at the Marines, striking and killing four Marines as they tried to rush the doors. The Marine snipers returned fire and downed three treasury agents, while the Marines in the courtyard dove for cover and fired into the doorway with their own M27 rifles. Three more Marines were struck down as they moved to flank the doors, and then IRS snipers appeared in the windows of the upper level, taking potshots in the general direction of the Marine sniper squads. One IRS sniper took a headshot and was felled, but the Marines quickly realized they were outmanned and outgunned as floodlamps illuminated the exterior and a voice echoed, “You’ve walked into a trap and are covered from an elevated position. Drop your weapons and surrender. We have you outnumbered 20 to 1.”\nThe Marines began a tactical retreat, laying down suppressive fire as they withdrew two-by-two through the gap in the wall from whence they came. The Marine snipers plunked at the windows and doorway while the men on the ground evaded a hailstorm of gunfire. Another Marine was wounded during the egress, and the remaining Marines escaped unharmed.\n“This was a loss,” a source in Gen. Berger’s office later told Real Raw News. “They obviously knew we were coming; we don’t know how. That place is printing money hand over fist and sending it overseas. We meant to stop it. Matters are worse now, but we’ll find a way.”\nGiven a news caption and an accompanying image, your task is to classify the type of multimodal misinformation.\n\nThe six possible categories are:\n\n- Image Fabrication: The image is forged.\n\n- Entity Inconsistency：There is a discrepancy between the key entities depicted in the textual and visual modalities.\n\n- Event Inconsistency：There is misrepresentation that arises from excessive inference in the written text for the attached image.\n\n- Time & Space Inconsistency：Using unaltered images or videos that depict past events, but falsely presenting them as recent events.\n\n- Ineffective Visual Information: The image consists of textual information  cannot provide evidence or proof for news content.\n\n- Real News: No form of multimodal misinformation is detected.\n\n\nPlease follow these steps:\n\n1.Reason step by step through an internal monologue, enclosed within <think> </think> tags.\n\n2.After reasoning,you can call the tool when need in the form:<tool> image_detection </tool> to detect image fabrication in the image.\n\n3.Based on the above information,provide your answer in the format: <answer> type of multimodal misinformation</answer>,for example: <answer> Real News </answer>.\n\n ",

        "problem": "<image>The news caption is: Liz Cheney Hanged at GITMO\nBy M. B. - April 27, 2023\nMonday, April 24\nStanding atop the gallows with a braided rope around her neck, Liz Cheney devoted her final breaths to excoriate President Donald J. Trump—who was not present—and his “minions,” accusing them of collectively subverting the Constitution to enforce a “private brand of justice.” Her eyes, open to narrow slits, like knife cuts, surveyed the officers who stood below and before her, as if memorizing faces for a future fight against them.\nAs is typical at hangings, a uniformed soldier tugged on the rope stretching from Cheney’s neck to a beam several feet above them, testing for slack and tension. He nodded at Vice Admiral Crandall, signaling his readiness to push the button.\nA ruddy-cheeked Cheney rambled on about how Trump and Adm. Crandall would eventually face their own tribunals with a predetermined verdict of guilty. She said an ineluctable fate awaited them and their co-conspirators. She held Trump and the admiral responsible for her father’s death and said her “people” would behead them.\n“You’re all doomed,” she said, shaking her shackled wrists, and she called Adm. Crandall an irritant, like a buzzing mosquito waiting to be squashed.\n“This isn’t personal; I take no enjoyment in my responsibilities,” Vice Adm. Crandall said. “You took an oath to our country—let me correct myself. It’s not your country. It stopped being your country the moment you betrayed the Constitution. You’re un-American. You, your people, you stand up there holding yourself blameless, no misgivings for what you’ve done. I pity you; I really do.”\nThe admiral seemed uncharacteristically patient. He gave Cheney more latitude than he had previous Deep Staters on the gallows. His face was devoid of expression, but he seemed genuinely interested in what made people like Cheney tick—What drove them to value greed over charity? What compelling force stripped them of decency? His dispassionate look became one of puzzlement as he listened to Cheney’s hateful monologue, her tongue flicking like a snake’s as she cursed the admiral and his family.\n“You murdered my father. You killed my friends. And for that you will die,” Cheney said.\nApparently the admiral had heard enough. He instructed the soldier on the platform to push the button, and a second later, Cheney was dangling in the wind. A Navy physician affirmed Cheney’s death and noted the time: 9:30 a.m., Monday, April 24.\nAdm. Crandall had a busy schedule. He still had to oversee the hanging of two corrupt feds and then board one of several flights that would eventually carry him to Guam, where tribunals would be held for the foreseeable future.\n(Visited 15,135 times, 15,135 visits today)\nGiven a news caption and an accompanying image, your task is to classify the type of multimodal misinformation.\n\nThe six possible categories are:\n\n- Image Fabrication: The image is forged.\n\n- Entity Inconsistency：There is a discrepancy between the key entities depicted in the textual and visual modalities.\n\n- Event Inconsistency：There is misrepresentation that arises from excessive inference in the written text for the attached image.\n\n- Time & Space Inconsistency：Using unaltered images or videos that depict past events, but falsely presenting them as recent events.\n\n- Ineffective Visual Information: The image consists of textual information  cannot provide evidence or proof for news content.\n\n- Real News: No form of multimodal misinformation is detected.\n\n\nPlease follow these steps:\n\n1.Reason step by step through an internal monologue, enclosed within <think> </think> tags.\n\n2.After reasoning,you can call the tool when need in the form:<tool> image_detection </tool> to detect image fabrication in the image.\n\n3.Based on the above information,provide your answer in the format: <answer> type of multimodal misinformation</answer>,for example: <answer> Real News </answer>.\n\n ",

Few were listening. \nThe following is a narrative taken from a 2008 Sunday \nmorning televised \"Meet The Press'. \nFrom Sunday's 07 Sept. 2008 11 : 48 : 04 EST, \nTelevised \"Meet the Press\" THE THEN Senator Obama was \nasked about his stance on the American Flag. \nGeneral Bill Gann' USAF (ret.) asked Obama to explain WHY he doesn't follow protocol when the National Anthem is played. \nThe General stated to Obama that according to the United \nStates Code, Title 36, Chapter 10, Sec. 171...During rendition of the national anthem, when the flag is \ndisplayed, all present (except those in uniform) are expected \nto stand at attention facing the flag with the right hand over \nthe heart. Or, at the very least, \"Stand and Face It\". \nNOW GET THIS !! \n'Senator Obama replied:\n\"As I've said about the flag pin, I don't want to be perceived \nas taking sides\". \"There are a lot of people in the world to \nwhom the American flag is a symbol of oppression..\" \"The \nanthem itself conveys a war-like message. You know, the \nbombs bursting in air and all that sort of thing.\" \n(ARE YOU READY FOR THIS???) \nObama continued : \n\"The National Anthem should \nbe 'swapped' for something less parochial and less bellicose. \nI like the song 'I'd Like To Teach the World To Sing'. If that \nwere our anthem, then, I might salute it. In my opinion, we \nshould consider reinventing our National Anthem as well \nas 'redesign' our Flag to better offer our enemies hope and \nlove. It's my intention, if elected, to disarm America to the \nlevel of acceptance to our Middle East Brethren. If we, as a Nation of warring people, conduct ourselves like the nations \nof Islam, where peace prevails - - - perhaps a state or period \nof mutual accord could exist between our governments ....\"\nWhen I become President, I will seek a pact of agreement to \nend hostilities between those who have been at war or in a \nstate of enmity, and a freedom from disquieting oppressive \nthoughts. We as a Nation, have placed upon the nations of \nIslam, an unfair injustice which is WHY my wife disrespects \nthe Flag and she and I have attended several flag burning \nceremonies in the past\". \n\"Of course now, I have found myself about to become the \nPresident of the United States and I have put my hatred \naside.
