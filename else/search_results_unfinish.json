The event **did spark widespread global protests** demanding the girls' release. Key facts confirming this include:\n\n1.  **Abductions:** Over 200 girls were abducted from Chibok Secondary School on April 14, 2014.\n2.  **Sparked Protests:** The kidnapping ignited immediate and sustained protests within Nigeria and internationally.\n3.  **Across the World:** Demonstrations occurred in numerous countries, including the USA, UK, Canada, France, Spain, India, South Africa, and many others, alongside massive protests within Nigeria.\n4.  **Demand Release:** The singular, unifying demand of all these protests was the safe return of the abducted girls, exemplified by the global #BringBackOurGirls campaign.\n\nThere are no factual errors in the caption; it correctly summarizes the documented international response to the Chibok abductions."

      "output": "The news caption states: \"The world s big oil exporters are due to attend the Opec meeting on Friday.\"\n\nFactual analysis:\n1. **OPEC Membership**: OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) consists of 13 member countries (e.g., Saudi Arabia, Iraq, UAE). However, several major oil exporters are **not** OPEC members, including Russia, the United States, Canada, and Norway. These non-OPEC exporters are not typically invited to standard OPEC meetings.\n2. **OPEC+ Framework**: While non-OPEC exporters like Russia participate in **OPEC+** meetings (a broader coalition), the caption explicitly refers to an \"Opec meeting,\" not OPEC+. Standard OPEC meetings are restricted to OPEC members only.\n3. **Attendance Implication**: The phrase \"the world s big oil exporters\" implies inclusion of top exporters beyond OPEC (e.g., Russia, US). Since these non-OPEC exporters do not attend regular OPEC meetings, the caption inaccurately suggests universal attendance.\n4. **Day of the Week**: While OPEC meetings can occur on any weekday, including Friday, this detail is not inherently erroneous and does not invalidate the core factual issue.\n\n**Conclusion**: The caption contains a factual error because it implies that all major oil exporters (including non-OPEC countries) will attend a standard OPEC meeting, which is incorrect. Non-OPEC exporters only participate in OPEC+ gatherings, not standard OPEC meetings.\n\n**Answer**: False"

Jollof rice is a culturally significant dish across West Africa (especially in Nigeria, Ghana, Senegal, and other nations), and variations in recipes often spark passionate debates. This sentiment is well-documented in media, cultural discussions, and even the \"Jollof Wars\" rivalry between countries. The use of \"can get touchy\" appropriately reflects that while not universal, strong emotional reactions to recipe alterations are a real and observable phenomenon.

However, the caption refers to it as the \"Bristoland\" sign. This appears to be a factual error, as the correct name is \"Bristol,\" not \"Bristoland.\" There is no widely recognized sign named \"Bristoland\" in Bristol.\n2. **Height**: The Bristol sign is approximately 8 feet high, which aligns with the caption.\n3. **Location**: The caption states the sign appeared \"opposite\" the Portway. The actual Bristol sign is situated **on** the Portway, specifically on the hillside above the road, not opposite it. The Portway is the main route itself, so describing the sign as \"opposite\" the Portway is inaccurate. The sign is adjacent to and visible from the Portway, but it is not positioned opposite the road.\n\nGiven the errors in the sign's name (\"Bristoland\" instead of \"Bristol\") and the location description (\"opposite\" the Portway instead of on it), the caption contains factual inaccuracies.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:  \n<answer>False</answer>"
